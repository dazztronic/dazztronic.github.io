## Overview

IBM Technology reframes prompt engineering as just one component within the broader, system-level discipline of context engineering. Their perspective emphasizes that robust AI agents require dynamic orchestration of memory, retrieval, state, and tools‚Äînot just clever prompts‚Äîto deliver accurate, context-aware results. This approach matters because it addresses the real-world complexity of deploying LLM-powered agents that must interact with live data, user preferences, and business constraints.

## üîç Key Insights & Learnings

### Creator's Unique Angle
IBM Technology's distinctive angle is the elevation of context engineering as a holistic discipline that programmatically assembles everything an LLM sees at inference time. They move beyond prompt tweaking to architecting agentic systems where memory, retrieval, state management, and tool integration are orchestrated to deliver reliable outcomes. Their methodology is system-centric, treating prompt engineering as a subset of a much larger context pipeline.

### The Core Problem
The core problem addressed is the inadequacy of prompt engineering alone to ensure LLM agents deliver accurate, policy-compliant, and contextually relevant outputs in complex, real-world scenarios‚Äîsuch as travel booking with company policies and dynamic user needs.

### The Solution Approach
Their approach is to design agentic AI systems where context engineering orchestrates all elements the LLM consumes: prompts, retrieved documents, memory (short- and long-term), state, and tool interfaces. They advocate for dynamic context assembly at runtime, using retrieval augmented generation (RAG), memory summarization, state tracking, and tool descriptions to inject relevant, up-to-date information into the LLM's context window. Prompt engineering is treated as a dynamic, context-populated template rather than a static instruction.

### Key Insights
- Prompt engineering is necessary but insufficient; system-level context engineering is required for robust, agentic AI.
- Dynamic context assembly‚Äîcombining memory, retrieval, and tools‚Äîenables LLMs to act with up-to-date, relevant knowledge.
- Role assignment, few-shot examples, chain-of-thought prompting, and constraint setting are prompt engineering techniques, but their effectiveness multiplies when embedded in a context-engineered system.
- RAG should return only the contextually relevant sections, not entire documents, to avoid overwhelming the LLM with irrelevant data.
- Tool integration requires explicit interface and constraint definitions to guide LLM usage safely and effectively.

### Concepts & Definitions
- Prompt engineering: Crafting the input text (instructions, examples, formatting) to steer LLM behavior.
- Context engineering: Programmatically assembling everything the LLM sees during inference‚Äîincluding prompts, retrieved documents, memory, and tools‚Äîto deliver accurate responses.
- Agentic AI: Systems where LLMs act as agents, requiring memory, state, retrieval, and tool access.
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): Connecting agents to dynamic knowledge sources via hybrid search, returning only contextually relevant information.
- State management: Tracking progress in multi-step agentic workflows to maintain task continuity.

### Technical Details & Implementation
- Short-term memory is managed by summarizing conversations to fit within context windows.
- Long-term memory uses vector databases to retrieve user preferences, past trips, and learned patterns.
- State management tracks multi-step processes (e.g., booking flights, hotels, ground transport) to maintain continuity.
- RAG employs hybrid search (semantic + keyword) to retrieve only relevant policy sections or exceptions.
- Tool descriptions specify what a tool does, when to use it, and its constraints, forming part of the context.
- Final prompts are dynamically assembled at runtime: approximately 80% context variables (from memory, state, RAG) and 20% static instructions.

### Tools & Technologies
- Vector databases for long-term memory retrieval.
- RAG pipelines for dynamic document/context retrieval.
- SQL databases and APIs accessed via tools with defined interfaces.
- JSON files for encoding business policies (e.g., travel policy constraints).

### Contrarian Takes & Different Approaches
- Prompt engineering is not the main event‚Äîcontext engineering is the real differentiator for robust, agentic AI.
- LLM outputs are only as good as the system-level context they receive, not just the cleverness of the prompt.

## üí° Key Takeaways & Actionable Insights

### What You Should Do
- Design agentic AI systems by orchestrating memory, retrieval, state, and tool access‚Äînot just prompt engineering.
- Use RAG to inject only the most relevant context into the LLM, avoiding information overload.
- Define explicit tool interfaces and constraints to guide LLM tool usage safely.
- Dynamically assemble prompts at runtime, populating them with current context from memory, state, and retrieval.

### What to Avoid
- Relying solely on prompt engineering can lead to brittle, context-blind agents that make obvious mistakes (e.g., booking a hotel in the wrong city).
- Failing to provide business policy context (e.g., travel expense limits) results in non-compliant agent actions.
- Overloading the LLM with entire documents instead of relevant sections reduces accuracy and efficiency.

### Best Practices
- Combine prompt engineering techniques (role assignment, few-shot, chain-of-thought, constraints) with dynamic context assembly.
- Summarize long conversations for short-term memory; use vector search for long-term memory.
- Track agent state across multi-step workflows to maintain context.
- Define tool interfaces and constraints as part of the context engineering pipeline.

### Personal Stories & Experiences
- Illustrated with the 'Agent Graeme' travel booking scenario, showing failures when context is missing (wrong city, over-budget booking) and how richer context enables correct, policy-compliant outcomes.
- Evolution from prompt-centric to system-centric thinking, recognizing the limits of prompt engineering alone.

### Metrics & Examples
- "Final prompt might be 80% dynamic content from context and 20% static instructions."
- "Ritz booked. ‚Ç¨900 a night. Champagne. Breakfast included." (as an example of a non-compliant booking due to missing policy context)
- "Estimated approval time: 6 to 8 weeks. The conference is in two weeks." (illustrating real-world workflow misalignment)
