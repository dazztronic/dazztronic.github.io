## Overview

Ryan Carson, a five-time founder, shares a pragmatic, hands-on 3-step AI coding workflow tailored for solo founders who need to move fast but can't afford to sacrifice clarity or execution quality. His perspective is grounded in real startup constraints‚Äîbalancing speed, resourcefulness, and the need to 'get your hands dirty'‚Äîmaking his approach highly actionable for builders navigating the new AI-powered coding landscape.

## üîç Key Insights & Learnings

### Creator's Unique Angle
Carson's approach is distinctive in its ruthless pragmatism: he combines traditional product rigor (PRDs and task lists) with advanced prompting inside AI-native tools, emphasizing that nobody has all the answers and the only way to mastery is iterative, messy experimentation. He demystifies AI coding by showing how to operationalize product thinking with LLMs, not just 'vibe' through code generation.

### The Core Problem
Solo founders and small teams often rush context and skip structured planning when using AI coding tools, leading to wasted cycles, unclear outputs, and subpar product execution. Carson targets the gap between AI's raw generative power and the disciplined, stepwise execution needed to actually ship robust products.

### The Solution Approach
Carson's workflow is a 3-step loop: (1) Write a clear PRD (Product Requirements Document) and feed it to the AI; (2) Use a custom 'generate tasks' prompt to break the PRD into actionable, markdown-formatted checklists; (3) Iteratively refine both prompts and outputs, leveraging the AI as a structured collaborator. He stresses specificity, context, and the importance of editing AI-generated instructions, treating the LLM as a junior partner whose outputs must be shaped and improved.

### Key Insights
- The biggest mistake is rushing context‚Äîimpatience with prompt setup leads to poor AI results.
- Nobody really knows the 'right' way to do AI coding yet; progress comes from hands-on trial and error.
- AI can make a solo founder feel like a full team, but only if you bring product discipline to your prompts and workflows.

### Concepts & Definitions
- PRD (Product Requirements Document): A structured document outlining what needs to be built, used as the primary context for AI task generation.
- Task List: A step-by-step breakdown of actionable items derived from the PRD, formatted in markdown with checkboxes for tracking progress.
- Prompt Engineering: The iterative process of refining instructions to the AI, learning from failures, and editing outputs for practical use.

### Technical Details & Implementation
- Uses Cursor (an AI-native code editor) as the central tool, integrating PRDs and task-generation prompts directly into the coding environment.
- Custom prompt files (e.g., 'generate tasks') specify output format (markdown with checkboxes) and define what constitutes a 'task' for the AI.
- Iterative prompt engineering: starts broad, then gets more specific based on what fails, editing AI-generated instructions for clarity and utility.

### Tools & Technologies
- Cursor (AI code editor): Used for integrating PRDs, prompts, and code generation in one workflow.
- Large Language Models (LLMs): Employed as assistants for both generating and refining tasks and instructions.

### Contrarian Takes & Different Approaches
- Challenges the 'vibe coding' trend‚Äîinsists that scalable execution requires more than just playing with AI tools.
- Rejects the myth of AI as a magical solution; emphasizes that nobody is an expert yet and learning comes from direct, messy engagement.
- Advocates for blending old-school product rigor with new AI capabilities, rather than abandoning structure for speed.

## üí° Key Takeaways & Actionable Insights

### What You Should Do
- Slow down and invest time in providing rich, specific context to the AI before expecting useful outputs.
- Create and iteratively refine prompt files that define both the structure and format of your desired outputs.
- Treat the AI as a junior collaborator‚Äîedit and improve its outputs, don't accept them blindly.

### What to Avoid
- Rushing through context setup is the most common and costly mistake‚Äîleads to wasted time and poor results.
- Assuming anyone has a perfect workflow for AI coding is a trap; expect to experiment and fail before finding what works.
- Skipping structured breakdown (like PRDs and task lists) results in chaotic, unscalable code and product decisions.

### Best Practices
- Always start with a clear PRD and use it as the foundation for all AI interactions.
- Define output formats (e.g., markdown with checkboxes) explicitly in your prompts to ensure actionable results.
- Iteratively test, edit, and refine both your prompts and the AI's outputs‚Äîtreat prompt engineering as an ongoing process.

### Personal Stories & Experiences
- Carson admits he can't match the depth of a dedicated product manager or CTO, but with this workflow, he can still build a company solo.
- He learned prompt engineering by failing repeatedly, then getting more specific and leveraging the AI to help write better instructions.
- He likens the process to parenting‚Äîbelieving in the AI's potential but knowing it needs guidance and structure.
