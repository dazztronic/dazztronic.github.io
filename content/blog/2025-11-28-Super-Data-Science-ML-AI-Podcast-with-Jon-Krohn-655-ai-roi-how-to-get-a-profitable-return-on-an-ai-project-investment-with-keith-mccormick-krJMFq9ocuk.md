## Overview

Keith McCormick delivers a candid, business-first perspective on AI project ROI, emphasizing that most failures stem from a lack of explicit profit-driven goals and a tendency to treat data science as open-ended exploration. He advocates for structured, outcome-oriented projects where predictive value is tightly linked to measurable business impact, challenging the prevailing culture of endless 'insight' work.

## 🔍 Key Insights & Learnings

### Creator's Unique Angle
McCormick's approach is distinctive in its insistence that every significant AI project must have a clear, measurable ROI target from the outset—treating exploratory 'insight' work as a separate, limited activity rather than the core of data science. He applies a consulting mindset, using frameworks like CRISP-DM but adapting them to focus on tangible predictions and business actions, not just technical deliverables.

### The Core Problem
Organizations frequently fail to realize profit from AI initiatives because they embark on expensive, open-ended projects without defining concrete business outcomes or mechanisms for value capture. This is exacerbated by a data science culture that often prioritizes exploration and 'insight' over actionable, revenue-linked deliverables.

### The Solution Approach
The methodology begins with a rigorous project kickoff: explicitly define what is being predicted, the tangible benefit of that prediction, and the business process that will act on the prediction. McCormick recommends using binary classification problems where possible, as these map cleanly to confusion matrices, enabling direct association of each outcome with costs or revenues. He leverages CRISP-DM as a backbone but narrows its focus to supervised learning with measurable business value, ensuring projects are led or sponsored by someone with c-suite influence to guarantee alignment and resources.

### Key Insights
- Treating data science as a help desk or endless insight generator is a profit killer—projects must be finite, with clear business deliverables.
- Binary classification is especially powerful for ROI because each confusion matrix quadrant can be mapped to specific financial outcomes.
- Successful AI projects require c-suite level sponsorship to ensure data science is a profit center, not a cost center.

### Concepts & Definitions
- "Insight projects" are defined as open-ended data explorations whose deliverable is typically a slide deck, not a business action—contrasted with predictive analytics projects.
- Confusion matrix: a tool for mapping binary classification outcomes to business costs or revenues.
- CRISP-DM: cross-industry standard process for data mining, reframed here as a practical project management tool for business-focused AI.

### Technical Details & Implementation
- CRISP-DM is used as a process model, but with a focus on supervised learning and explicit business value.
- Binary classification projects are favored due to their clear mapping to business metrics via the confusion matrix.
- Projects are structured with defined kickoff, roles (data steward, sponsor), and deliverables tied to business action.

### Tools & Technologies
- CRISP-DM (as a project management/process model)
- SPSS (historical context, not current recommendation)

### Contrarian Takes & Different Approaches
- Challenges the prevailing wisdom that open-ended data exploration is a valid core activity for data science teams—argues this should be strictly limited.
- Questions the applicability of CRISP-DM to unsupervised learning, suggesting it is best suited for supervised, business-driven projects.

## 💡 Key Takeaways & Actionable Insights

### What You Should Do
- Start every AI project by defining what is being predicted, the business value of that prediction, and the action to be taken.
- Limit exploratory 'insight' work to a small, scheduled portion of time; do not let it dominate the team's output.
- Ensure every major project has c-suite sponsorship and a clear profit or cost-saving goal.

### What to Avoid
- Avoid open-ended projects with no measurable business deliverable—these drain resources and rarely deliver ROI.
- Do not let the data science team devolve into a help desk or endless exploration unit.
- Beware of projects where the only output is a slide deck or insight with no actionable follow-through.

### Best Practices
- Use binary classification with confusion matrix analysis to directly tie model outcomes to business metrics.
- Adopt CRISP-DM but tailor it to focus on supervised, business-outcome-driven projects.
- Structure teams and projects so that business value is the north star from kickoff to delivery.

### Personal Stories & Experiences
- Use binary classification with confusion matrix analysis to directly tie model outcomes to business metrics.
- Adopt CRISP-DM but tailor it to focus on supervised, business-outcome-driven projects.
- Structure teams and projects so that business value is the north star from kickoff to delivery.

### Metrics & Examples
- References projects costing hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars, underscoring the need for ROI discipline.
- Describes mapping each confusion matrix outcome to a specific income or cost, making ROI calculation explicit.
