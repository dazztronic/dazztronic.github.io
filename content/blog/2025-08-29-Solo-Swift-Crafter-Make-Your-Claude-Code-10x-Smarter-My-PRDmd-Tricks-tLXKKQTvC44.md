## Overview

This video addresses how to make AI coding assistants like Claude and Cursor significantly more effective by creating and maintaining a high-quality, living PRD.md (Product Requirements Document) directly in your code repository. It matters because most AI-generated code is generic or off-target without clear, contextual product guidance, leading to subpar apps and wasted effort.

## üîç Key Insights & Learnings

### The Core Problem
The main problem is that AI coding tools (like Claude and Cursor) often generate code or suggestions that are generic, lack context, or miss the mark because they don't truly understand the product vision, requirements, or user needs. This is exacerbated by the use of superficial, static, or 'for show' PRDs that don't actually guide the AI or the developer. As a result, solo developers and indie app creators struggle to produce polished, user-focused apps and end up with MVPs that feel incomplete or uninspired.

### The Solution Approach
The solution is to create a 'living, breathing' PRD.md file in your repository that is actively maintained and written for both yourself and your AI tools. This document should be detailed, honest, and specific, outlining not just features but also the product's motivation, user experience goals, and what 'done' means for each release. The PRD.md is used as a rule or onboarding document for AI agents like Claude and Cursor, ensuring they have the same context and standards as the developer. The process is iterative and conversational, treating the AI as a product coach and collaborator, not just a code generator.

### Key Insights
- A high-quality, up-to-date PRD.md dramatically improves the relevance and quality of AI-generated code and suggestions.
- The PRD.md should be written as a real, evolving conversation‚Äînot a static corporate doc or a one-off AI-generated artifact.
- Explicitly stating the product's motivation, user pain points, and what 'complete' means helps both AI and human collaborators stay aligned.
- Onboarding AI agents with your PRD.md as a rule in tools like Cursor ensures consistent context across sessions.
- Treating the AI as a product coach (not just a code monkey) leads to better product outcomes and a more intentional workflow.

### Technical Details & Implementation
- Place a PRD.md (or .prd if preferred) file in the root of your repository.
- Use the PRD.md as a rule or onboarding document in Cursor or Claude to provide context for every session.
- Structure the PRD.md with: an overview of what the app does, motivation/problem statement, user experience goals (e.g., modern UI, haptics, accessibility), and explicit definitions of 'done' for each release.
- Example PRD.md content: overview ("intuitive modern NFC tag workflows"), motivation ("iOS NFC tools are clunky and dated"), UX goals ("clean SwiftUI interface, bottom tab bar, haptics, dark mode, accessibility").
- Iteratively update the PRD.md as the product evolves and as new insights are gained from AI conversations.

### Tools & Technologies
- Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant)
- Cursor (AI-powered code editor/agent)
- SwiftUI (for iOS app UI)
- PRD.md (Product Requirements Document in Markdown format)

## üí° Key Takeaways & Actionable Insights

### What You Should Do
- Create and maintain a PRD.md file in your repo before starting significant AI-assisted coding.
- Onboard your AI tools (Claude, Cursor) with your PRD.md as a rule or context document.
- Write the PRD.md as an honest, evolving conversation‚Äîinclude what matters, what doesn't, and what 'done' means.
- Explicitly state user pain points and your product's unique value in the PRD.md.
- Update the PRD.md regularly as your product vision and requirements change.

### What to Avoid
- Do NOT rely on generic, one-off AI-generated PRDs‚Äîthey lack depth and context.
- Avoid static, 'for show' corporate docs that don't reflect the real state or needs of your product.
- Don't treat the AI as a code generator without context‚Äîthis leads to irrelevant or low-quality output.
- Beware of MVPs that feel unfinished or generic due to lack of clear product direction.

### Best Practices
- Use a living PRD.md as the single source of truth for both yourself and your AI tools.
- Start every PRD with a clear overview, motivation, and explicit user experience goals.
- Treat the AI as a collaborator and product coach‚Äîengage in iterative, back-and-forth conversations.
- Set your own standards for 'done' and make them explicit at the top of your PRD.md.
- Prioritize clarity and honesty in your documentation to ensure alignment and quality.
