## Overview

jordanUrbsAI delivers a no-nonsense, hands-on approach to building better AI-powered apps by leveraging a simple but rigorously detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD). Their perspective is grounded in personal experience as a non-coder navigating the AI coding landscape, emphasizing the transformative impact of structured documentation over 'vibe coding' and tool-hopping.

## üîç Key Insights & Learnings

### Creator's Unique Angle
jordanUrbsAI's distinctive approach is the insistence that a well-crafted PRD is the single most powerful lever for improving AI-assisted app development, regardless of which AI coding tool is used. They treat the PRD as a living, iterative artifact that anchors both the developer and the AI, preventing chaos and rework. Their methodology is refreshingly pragmatic, blending non-coder empathy with a builder's mindset, and they openly share their evolving tool stack and workflow tweaks.

### The Core Problem
The core problem addressed is the unreliability and frustration of 'vibe coding'‚Äîjumping into AI-assisted coding without clear documentation‚Äîwhich leads to inconsistent results, wasted time, and frequent restarts. This is especially acute for non-coders or those new to AI co-pilots, who may lack the mental models to guide the AI effectively.

### The Solution Approach
Their solution is to always start with a PRD, even if it's rough, and iteratively refine it with the help of an AI assistant (e.g., Claude Sonnet). The process involves explicitly stating the app's purpose, design requirements, data models, third-party integrations, and deployment needs. The PRD is continuously updated as new requirements or insights emerge, and is always fed directly into the AI co-pilot to ensure alignment. The creator emphasizes the importance of specifying the database schema early to maintain consistency across tools and avoid front-end/back-end mismatches.

### Key Insights
- A detailed PRD, even if imperfect, dramatically improves the quality and consistency of AI-generated code.
- Switching tools (e.g., from Bolt to Cursor) without a single source of truth like a PRD leads to chaos and mismatched implementations.
- Personal lesson: Failing to define the database schema upfront resulted in repeated mismatches and costly rework.

### Concepts & Definitions
- "Vibe coding": Jumping into code generation with AI without structured documentation, relying on intuition and improvisation.
- "Product Requirements Document (PRD)": A living document detailing what the app should do, how it should look, its data models, integrations, and deployment requirements, serving as the AI's north star.
- "Single source of truth": The PRD acts as the definitive reference for all requirements, ensuring consistency across tools and sessions.

### Technical Details & Implementation
- Starts with Claude Sonnet to co-create the PRD, feeding in requirements and iterating live.
- Documents specifics like SEO requirements, design themes (e.g., dark mode with purple undertones), and form integrations (e.g., ConvertKit form ID, not full API).
- Insists on mocking up the database schema in the PRD to guide both front-end and back-end code generation.
- Uses a mix of tools: Claude Sonnet, Rue Code with Claude's API, and occasionally Bolt or Cursor, but always anchored by the PRD.

### Tools & Technologies
- Claude Sonnet (primary AI assistant for PRD creation and iteration)
- Rue Code (with Claude's API, for coding and deployment)
- Bolt, Cursor (alternative AI coding tools, but less preferred due to cost and workflow friction)
- ConvertKit (for email capture, using form ID only)
- Ghost (mentioned as a full-featured blogging alternative, but not used for the build)

### Contrarian Takes & Different Approaches
- Rejects the idea that you can get good results from AI coding tools without structured documentation.
- Argues that tool choice is secondary to documentation quality‚Äîany AI co-pilot can perform well if fed a solid PRD.
- Suggests that even non-coders can build sophisticated apps if they focus on clear requirements and leverage AI for iteration.

## üí° Key Takeaways & Actionable Insights

### What You Should Do
- Before coding, spend 10-15 minutes drafting a PRD with your AI assistant, covering purpose, design, data models, and integrations.
- Always include a database schema in your PRD to prevent mismatches between front-end and back-end code.
- Continuously update the PRD as requirements evolve and feed the latest version into your AI co-pilot before each major coding session.

### What to Avoid
- Do not rely on 'vibe coding'‚Äîit leads to confusion, wasted effort, and frequent restarts.
- Switching AI coding tools without a unified PRD causes inconsistencies and technical debt.
- Neglecting to define the database schema early results in broken or mismatched app components.

### Best Practices
- Treat the PRD as a living document, updating it with every new insight or requirement.
- Use the PRD as the first input to any AI coding session, regardless of the tool.
- Document even seemingly minor requirements (e.g., font choices, SEO tags) to ensure the AI captures your intent.

### Personal Stories & Experiences
- Admits to having to start over multiple times due to lack of documentation and mismatched database schemas.
- Shares the evolution from using Cursor (expensive, less efficient) to Rue Code with Claude's API (cheaper, more productive).
- Describes the frustration and wasted time experienced before adopting the PRD-first workflow.

### Metrics & Examples
- Mentions saving significant money by switching from Cursor ($200-$250/month) to Rue Code with Claude's API ($20/month) while increasing productivity.
- References the time saved and reduction in restarts after adopting the PRD-first approach, though no exact numbers are given.
