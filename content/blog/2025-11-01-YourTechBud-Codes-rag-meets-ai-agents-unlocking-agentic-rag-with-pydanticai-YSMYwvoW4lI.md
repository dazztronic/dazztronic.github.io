## Overview

This video demonstrates how to combine Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines with agentic workflows using PydanticAI, enabling dynamic tool selection (vector vs. keyword search) within a single agent. The approach is practical, focusing on modularity and real-world retrieval challenges, and highlights the importance of agent-driven context construction for more adaptable AI systems.

## üîç Key Insights & Learnings

### Creator's Unique Angle
The distinctive methodology lies in merging RAG with agent frameworks, specifically leveraging PydanticAI to create agents that autonomously choose between multiple retrieval tools (vector search or keyword search) based on the query. This agentic RAG setup is presented as a modular, extensible pattern rather than a monolithic pipeline, emphasizing tool abstraction and agent decision-making.

### The Core Problem
The main challenge addressed is the limitation of static RAG pipelines, which often rely on a single retrieval method and lack flexibility in handling diverse queries or data types. In the current landscape, where LLMs frequently lack domain-specific knowledge, there is a need for systems that can dynamically select the best retrieval strategy and compose context on the fly.

### The Solution Approach
The workflow starts with user queries, which are routed through an agent built with PydanticAI. The agent has access to multiple retrieval tools (vector search and keyword search, both backed by LanceDB) and decides which to invoke based on the query. The retrieved context is then passed alongside the query to the LLM. The design encourages modularity‚Äîtools are simple, interchangeable, and the agent logic is decoupled from retrieval specifics. The presenter also experiments with retrieval parameters (e.g., top-k) and discusses the potential for graph-based retrieval for more complex queries.

### Key Insights
- Agentic RAG enables more flexible, maintainable pipelines by decoupling retrieval logic from agent orchestration.
- Tool abstraction allows the same agent to invoke different retrieval strategies without the LLM being aware of the underlying mechanics.
- Fine-tuning retrieval parameters (like top-k) and considering graph-based approaches can significantly improve answer quality for complex information needs.

### Concepts & Definitions
- "Context" is defined as the set of retrieved information chunks relevant to the user query, constructed via vector or keyword search.
- Agentic RAG is framed as a system where agents, not static pipelines, orchestrate retrieval and context assembly, allowing dynamic tool selection.
- Tool calls are explained as modular, interchangeable functions the agent can invoke to fetch data, abstracting away retrieval details from the LLM.

### Technical Details & Implementation
- Uses PydanticAI to define agents and tool interfaces.
- Implements two retrieval tools: vector search and keyword (full-text) search, both via LanceDB.
- Agent receives a query, decides which tool to call, retrieves context, and prompts the LLM with both query and context.
- Demonstrates adjusting retrieval parameters (e.g., increasing top-k from 7 to 20 and adding a re-ranker) for better results.

### Tools & Technologies
- PydanticAI (for agent and tool definition and orchestration)
- LanceDB (as the backend for both vector and keyword search tools)
- Open-source LLMs (used as the language model for answering queries)

### Contrarian Takes & Different Approaches
- Advocates for agent-driven RAG over traditional static pipelines, challenging the assumption that a single retrieval method is sufficient.
- Suggests that open-source models and modular toolchains can outperform more monolithic, closed solutions in adaptability and transparency.

## üí° Key Takeaways & Actionable Insights

### What You Should Do
- Structure your RAG pipeline as an agent with modular tool calls to allow flexible retrieval strategies.
- Start with basic vector and keyword search tools, then iterate by tuning retrieval parameters and adding more specialized tools as needed.
- Print and inspect retrieved context to debug and improve retrieval quality.

### What to Avoid
- Relying solely on one retrieval method (e.g., vector search) can lead to incomplete or irrelevant context for certain queries.
- Failing to modularize tools and agent logic can create brittle, hard-to-maintain pipelines.
- Overly verbose logging can clutter debugging‚Äîbalance transparency with readability.

### Best Practices
- Keep tools simple and focused; let the agent handle orchestration and decision-making.
- Iteratively adjust retrieval parameters (like top-k) and evaluate results to optimize performance.
- Consider graph-based retrieval for queries that require information traversal or relationship mapping.

### Personal Stories & Experiences
- Keep tools simple and focused; let the agent handle orchestration and decision-making.
- Iteratively adjust retrieval parameters (like top-k) and evaluate results to optimize performance.
- Consider graph-based retrieval for queries that require information traversal or relationship mapping.

### Metrics & Examples
- Demonstrated that increasing top-k retrieval from 7 to 20 improved the completeness of answers.
- Provided concrete examples using Pok√©mon move queries to illustrate retrieval effectiveness and limitations.
